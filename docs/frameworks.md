# MECE Consulting Framework Collection

---

## 1. M&A VALUE CREATION FRAMEWORK

### Description
Use this framework to evaluate whether an acquisition creates value and where that value comes from. It separates intrinsic value from synergy-driven upside and explicitly forces you to surface integration and execution risks.

### Example Case Prompt
A global pharmaceutical company is considering acquiring a mid-sized biotech with a late-stage oncology drug. The target is pre-profit but growing rapidly. The CEO wants to know whether the acquisition creates shareholder value and whether the deal should proceed given regulatory, integration, and IP risks.

### Framework

### 1. Standalone Value
- Profitability  
- Growth  
- Strategic fit  
- Valuation  
  - a) Market cap  
  - b) NPV  
  - c) Enterprise value  
  - d) Comparables analysis  

### 2. Synergies (= additional value created)
- Revenue growth  
  - e.g. cross-selling, reduction of competition, access to new markets  
- Cost reduction  
  - e.g. product advancement through shared resources, reduced salaries, marketing & channels, streamlined processes & negotiating power  

### 3. Capabilities & Risks
- Integration  
- Antitrust & regulations  
- Leadership & culture  
- IP concerns  

### Framework Tips
- Always separate **value without the deal** from **value because of the deal**.
- Quantify synergies conservatively; overestimation is a common pitfall.
- Flag risks early—especially regulatory and cultural ones—to appear realistic.

## 2. OPERATIONS IMPROVEMENT / PROCESS REDESIGN FRAMEWORK

### Description
This framework diagnoses operational inefficiencies and identifies concrete levers to improve cost, speed, capacity, or productivity.

### Example Case Prompt
A global manufacturer of industrial equipment is missing delivery targets and experiencing margin compression despite steady demand. Management suspects operational inefficiencies and wants a clear plan to improve throughput, reduce costs, and protect quality.

### Framework

### 1. Map Process
- Steps (e.g. value chain)  
- Stakeholders  
- Performance metrics  
  - e.g. capacity utilization, bottlenecks, lead time  

### 2. Investigate Levers
- Eliminate & cut waste  
  - e.g. automation, location design  
- Reduce costs  
  - e.g. bulk renegotiation, outsourcing, network design  
- Increase speed  
  - e.g. capacity, network design  
- Increase quantity  
  - capacity & utilization  
- Increase productivity  
- Better anticipation  
  - forecasting, S&OP  

### 3. Gains & Risks
- Effect on success metric  
- Impact on brand, satisfaction, quality, profits  

**Guiding note:**  
- Identify success metric immediately & adapt levers  

### Framework Tips
- Start with the **constraint** (bottleneck) before listing solutions.
- Tie every lever to a measurable KPI.
- Call out trade-offs between efficiency and quality.

## 5. MARKET EXPANSION / GROWTH DECISION FRAMEWORK

### Description
Used to evaluate whether expansion makes sense given demand dynamics, supply constraints, and economics.

- Risks  

### Framework Tips
- Growth without margin is a red flag—always check economics.
- Separate **market growth** from **share shift**.
- Watch for hidden fixed costs in expansion.

## 8. ORGANIC VS INORGANIC GROWTH FRAMEWORK

### Description
Helps decide how a company should grow and through which levers, balancing speed, control, risk, and cost.

### Example Case Prompt
A mid-sized industrial company has set a target to double revenues in five years. The board wants to understand whether this growth should come from acquisitions, partnerships, or internal expansion.

### Framework

### 1. Organic (= own capabilities & efforts)
- Inside core (= existing sources)  
  - Improve product, new distribution channels, quality, price, marketing  
- Outside core (= new sources)  
  - New segments  
  - New geography (e.g. Asia)  
  - New product to segments  
  - Entirely new business  

### 2. Inorganic (= external efforts)
- Acquisition  
  - Immediate revenue boost  
  - Synergies & control  
  - BUT costly + integration  
- JV / shared resources  
  - Risk sharing  
  - BUT limited control & scaling risk  
- Partnership  
  - Fast & cheap  
  - BUT no control, time risk  

**Guiding note:**  
- Understand what to grow (revenue, profit, quantity, etc.) & prioritize organic levers  

### Framework Tips
- Organic = control, inorganic = speed. Say this explicitly.
- Match growth method to capital availability.
- Integration risk often dominates inorganic outcomes.

## 9. PROFITABILITY FRAMEWORK

### Description
A foundational framework to decompose profitability problems or build financial intuition from first principles, using the formular PROFIT = REVENUE - COSTS = VOLUME * PRICE – (VOLUME * VARIABLE COSTS + FIXED COSTS)

### Example Case Prompt
A media company reports flat revenues but declining profits across several business units. Management wants a clear breakdown of where value is being lost and which segments matter most.

### Framework

### Revenue
- Unit volume × price per unit  

### Cost
- Variable  
  - e.g. direct labor, raw material, packaging, commission  
- Fixed  
  - e.g. rent, taxes, administrative salaries, loan repayment, depreciation  

### Segmentation Lens
- By products  
- Distribution channels  
- Geography  
- Customer type  
- Industry vertical  

**Guiding notes:**
- Identify leverage point & ask “why”  
- If volume issue → benchmark competition  

### Framework Tips
- Always sanity-check magnitudes.
- Segment early if numbers feel “too averaged.”
- Use this as a base before applying advanced frameworks.
