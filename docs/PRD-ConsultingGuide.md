## 1. Product Vision

The website consists of two parts:

2) Consulting Guide which dives into the details of the application, the interviews & firms

This document specifies **Part 2: Consulting Guide** in full detail.

## 6. Case Interview

### Format
Carousel, devoting one slide for each case interview step, followed by a divider line with additional information.

---

### 1. Case Opening & Clarifying Questions

**Goal:**  
Fully understand the problem and confirm alignment with the interviewer before structuring.

**Best Practices:**
- Reformulate the case in your own words  
  Example:  
  “So the client, a European grocery retailer, is considering entering the French ready-meal market. Our goal is to assess feasibility and profitability, correct?”
- Clarify the objective  
  Always confirm what success looks like: profit growth, market share, ROI, or something else.
- Use **ROLSPCD** to check clarity:
  - R – Reformulate
  - O – Objective
  - L – Location (geography or scope)
  - S – Strategy / Time horizon / Business model
  - P – Product / Service definition
  - C – Competition / Benchmarks
  - D – Distribution / Channels

**Tips:**
- Choose clarifying questions that help your framework rather than asking for data prematurely.
- This phase is also an opportunity to show structured communication and business curiosity.

---

### 2. Structuring the Problem

You have about **90 seconds** to design and present a **MECE structure** (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive).

**Best Practices:**
- Familiar frameworks (Profitability, Market-entry, M&A, Growth, Pricing) are great for inspiration but must be tailored.
- Announce structure like a consultant:
  > “To assess this opportunity, I’ll look at three key areas: first, market attractiveness; second, the company’s competitive fit; and third, financial feasibility…”

**Tips:**
- Introduce high-level buckets first (Revenue / Cost / Risk or External / Internal / Financials).
- Visually communicate structure clearly as you speak.

---

### 3. Case Math

You will face both operational math (profit, ROI, breakeven) and valuation / market sizing.

**Best Practices:**
1. Clarify numbers
2. Walk through your setup aloud
3. Think out loud
4. Sense-check results
5. Tie numbers back to the case

Tip: Round numbers smartly and check arithmetic concisely.

---

### 4. Brainstorming

Used when asked for ideas.

**Best Practices:**
- Take 15–20 seconds to structure
- 5–6 ideas across 2–3 MECE buckets is ideal
- Present clearly

Tip: Always link ideas back to feasibility and the case objective.

---

### 5. Exhibit Analysis

**Best Practices:**
1. Describe the exhibit briefly
2. Highlight a key insight
3. Analyze causes or implications
4. Tie back to the case question

Tip: Don’t narrate the chart — interpret it.

---

### 6. Market Sizing

**Best Practices:**
1. Clarify what you are sizing
2. Set up the formula first
3. Check assumptions as you go
4. Segment logically
5. Test sensitivity

---

### 7. Case Closing

**Best Practices:**
- Summarize analysis
- State recommendation directly
- Support with rationale
- Add one risk & mitigation
- Outline next steps

Tone should be confident but flexible.
