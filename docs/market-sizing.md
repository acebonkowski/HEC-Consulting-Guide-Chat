# Market Sizing Numbers to Remember

---

**Tips & Best Practices** 

### To size markets in case interviews, start by clarifying exactly what you are estimating (e.g., annual revenue, number of users, units sold) and why it matters for the client’s decision, then confirm all key definitions and boundaries (geography, segment, time horizon). Draw a clear structure before calculating: pick demand‑side or supply‑side (or both as a cross‑check), decide on top‑down vs bottom‑up, and lay out a simple logic tree with explicit, sanity‑checkable assumptions. As you calculate, sense‑check each step with realistic ranges, watch for bottlenecks (e.g., capacity limits, maximum usage per person), and interpret your result in business terms rather than just stating a number. Always remember that any benchmark numbers (population, income, households, etc.) are rough, so you must adapt them and verify them for the specific office/country you are interviewing for, as the figures below are non‑exhaustive and approximate.
